Hi, my name is Bryan Solomon and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'm a University of Iowa graduate, graduating with my Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science.
I made this github to hopefully push myself to sharpen my skills and create some programs to be able to put on my resume to be able to showcase my
skills.
